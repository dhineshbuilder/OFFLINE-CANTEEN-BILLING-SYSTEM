```

### Main Flow

1. Cashier opens the billing screen and adds menu items to the cart.
2. Cart state is handled in `src/store/useStore.ts`.
3. When a bill is printed, the order and order items are stored in IndexedDB through `src/db/db.ts`.
4. Receipt data is converted to ESC/POS bytes in `src/utils/bluetoothPrinter.ts`.
5. Admin screens read and write categories, items, settings, orders, and order items through Dexie.
6. Sales dashboard aggregates IndexedDB order data into filtered reports.

### Data Model

| Store | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `categories` | Menu category records with English and optional Tamil names. |
| `items` | Menu item records with name, Tamil name, price, category, and image data. |
| `orders` | Bill-level sales records with date and total amount. |
| `orderItems` | Line items for each bill, including quantity and price snapshot. |
| `settings` | App-level settings such as language and printer metadata. |

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- npm
- Chrome or Edge for Web Bluetooth printer use

### Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/6ixmindslabs-hue/CANTEENBILLING_SYSTEM.git
cd CANTEENBILLING_SYSTEM
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL shown by Vite, usually:

```text
http://localhost:5173/
```

### Admin Login

The default admin PIN is:

```text
1234
```

You can change it from the Settings page after logging in.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Vercel:

```text
https://canteen-billing-system.vercel.app/
```

Vercel settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Output directory | `dist` |
| SPA routing | `vercel.json` rewrites all routes to `index.html` |

## Printer Notes

- Bluetooth printing uses the Web Bluetooth API, so it requires a supported browser and a secure context.
- Localhost works during development.
- Deployed HTTPS works for production.
- The printer utility targets common 58mm ESC/POS Bluetooth thermal printers.
- Printer selection and connection happen from the browser, so the connected device is not stored on a server.

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite development server. |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and build the production app. |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the built app locally. |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint. |

## Notes

- Data is stored in the browser using IndexedDB, so each device has its own local canteen data unless a backup file is exported and imported.
- The admin PIN is a local client-side guard intended for lightweight counter use, not server-grade authentication.
- Backup export includes categories, items, item images, orders, order items, and settings.
